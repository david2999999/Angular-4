## Angular 4

Angular is a JavaScript open-source front-end web application framework. 
It is primarily sustained by Google together with an extended community of 
people and companies, to approach many of the challenges faced when developing single page, 
cross platform, performant applications. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.

Angular is a great tool that will:

* Enable you to create software quicker and with less effort
* Result in a more maintainable software
* Encourage good programming practices and design patterns like MVC
* Allow you to collaborate easier with other people
* Allow you to become proficient in a reasonable time
* Address problems that may arise in your software architecture such as Dependency Injection, DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself), etc

## Consistency

Code consistency is an important goal to strive for in any code base. If you or your team have to support production applications then you understand how important consistency is and why it leads to better maintenance. So what does Angular offer that provides consistency for teams? The overall framework is based on components and services that you can think of as Lego blocks. All components and services start out the same way. For example, all Angular components do the following:

1) Import required ES2015 modules
2) Define a @Component decorator (metadata)
3) Place code in a component class
